I am a second year graduate student in the department of Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). My interests span a broad range of sub-fields in Computer Science, including Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics and Computer Vision. I am working on my graduate thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Ahmed Qureshi](https://qureshiahmed.github.io/#research) in the area of multi-agent rearrangement planning. I have also worked with [Prof. Kamyar Azizzadenesheli](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/kamyar/index.html) in the area of reinforcement learning. 

Prior to my graduate studies, I worked at Adobe Systems for three years as Software Development Engineer (2018-2019) and Software Development Engineer II (2020-2021), where I learned valuable professional skills. I worked on developing and maintaining an extensibility platform which served in-house platform teams at Adobe and external developers to develop and deploy new features and plugins inside Adobe flagship applications. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee in 2018 with minors in Electronics and Communication Engineering, along with majors in Computer Science.

I like to spend my leisure time outdoors, doing hiking and adventure sports. Apart from this, I play table tennis and shuttle badminton. I also enjoy playing board games (big fan of Catan!).
