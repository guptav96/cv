# About Me

_Passionate about Machine Learning and AI, software development and finance._

(765)-701-9946 / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guptav96/) / [Resume](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/gupta690_purdue_edu/EabjK8-bCr5DtozDyN_TBI0BiD6L14KQ-p-MB1Hhiszr2Q?e=K240hu) / [GitHub](https://github.com/guptav96/)

I am a second year graduate student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). My interests span a broad range of sub-fields in Computer Science, including Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics and Computer Vision. I am working on my graduate thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Ahmed Qureshi](https://qureshiahmed.github.io/#research) in the area of multi-agent rearrangement planning. I have also worked with [Prof. Kamyar Azizzadenesheli](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/kamyar/index.html) in the area of reinforcement learning. 

Prior to my graduate studies, I worked at Adobe Systems for three years as Software Development Engineer (2018-2019) and Software Development Engineer II (2020-2021), where I learned valuable technical and professional skills. I worked on developing and maintaining an extensibility platform which served in-house platform teams at Adobe and external developers to develop and deploy new features and plugins inside Adobe flagship applications. I graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) in 2018 with minors in Electronics and Communication Engineering, along with majors in Computer Science.

I like to spend my leisure time outdoors, doing hiking and adventure sports. Apart from this, I play table tennis and shuttle badminton. I also enjoy playing board games (big fan of Catan!).

## üè´ Teaching

_An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. - Benjamin Franklin_

I believe in the fact that knowledge increases by sharing but not by saving. It helps me to understand the concepts on a higher level, and motivates me and the students to appreciate the importance and impact of the subject. I have been a teaching assistant to the following courses:
- Fall 2021: Data Structures and Algorithms (CS251)
- Spring 2022: Compilers: Principles and Practice (CS352)
- Fall 2022: Statistical Machine Learning (CS578)
